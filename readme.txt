This is modified version of Saxon 8.1.1.  Changes include
1. The package net.sf was renamed org.orbeon.   This was done to remove 
   the possiblity of conflicts when deploying Saxon as part of a web app.
2. A couple of minor bugs were fixed.

The license terms for 8.1.1 have been included in the directory 'conditions'
that is a sub directory of the directory containing this file.
